v2.0.3 / 2020-02-23
--------------------

#### Notes

 * None

#### Improvements

 * None

#### Bug Fixes

 * `bugfix` Fixed `NoSuchMethodError` when using Portico in Java apps that have their
            own copy of the HLA interface spec classes on the classpath. This would
            happen whenever a standard exception was thrown. See #301.

 * `bugfix` Stopped LRC keeping background threads alive when using HLA-Evolved's
            immediate callback delivery feature. See #302.


v2.0.2 / 2015-12-31
--------------------

#### Notes

 * `note` Bundled JRE version has been updated to `1.8.0_66`

#### Improvements

 * `improve` Fixed a problem that made Portico difficult to use in private Maven repos.
             This would manifest as extremely long startup time as a large number of
             non-Portico related jar files were unnecessarily scanned. (`#148`)

 * `improve` Added ability to generate a sandbox that includes a JRE by calling the
             `sandbox.full` target. This is useful when building from source for use
             with `RTI_HOME` directly set to the sandbox directory. (`#130`)

#### Bug Fixes

 * `bugfix` Fixed a bug that would cause the truncation of values for large attribute
            reflections or parameters sent. If a value of an individual attributes or
            parameter was >`989b`, all values after the 989th byte were being trucated
            to `0`. (#65)

 * `bugfix` Fixed a problem preventing use of Portico with time managed federates
            generated by Pitch Developer Studio (`#41`)

 * `bugfix` Fixed a problem where calling `tick(min_time,max_time)` would not tick
            for at least `min_time` if there were messages waiting for processing.
            (`#53`)

 * `bugfix` Fixed a problem with `IEEE-1516e` Java interface referencing wrong
            `LogicalTimeFactory` implementation with Integer-based times. (`#142`)


v2.0.1 / 2014-10-22
--------------------

#### Notes

 * `note` We have updated packaged version of Java to 8u20. The Java 8 stream will
          be the default for development going forward. Generated bytecode is
          currently backwards compatible with Java 6, which reached end-of-life by
          Oracle in February 2013. Java 6 support will be deprecated as of `v2.1`.
          It may still work, but there are no guarantees made beyond that time.

#### Improvements

 * `improve` Standard development environment and packaged JRE has been updated
             to Java 8u20 on all platforms. (`PORT-149`)
 
 * `improve` Patch to allow the setting of java system properties from within
             the C++ interface. (`#30` - JeanPhilippeLebel)

 * `improve` Logging output from the 1516e interface will now be send to a file if the
            `PORTICO_REDIRECT` environment variable is set. (`#39` - raymondfrancis)

#### Bug Fixes

 * `bugfix` Reduced warnings and other compilation problems for c++ interface
            on Ubuntu LTS releases (`PORT-17`)

 * `bugfix` Portico c++ interface and unit tests now compile and complete
            successfully on Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9). (`PORT-146`)

 * `bugfix` Generated java code now backwards compatible to Java 6 (`PORT-139`)

 * `bugfix` Fixed "Insufficient data" exceptions in 1516e C++ encoding helpers (`#34` - lumixen)

 * `bugfix` Fixed encoding errors in the ieee1516e aggregate structs (`#35` - lumixen)

 * `bugfix` Fixed intermittent crash in the 1516e C++ interface that happened when multiple
            threads accessed the `RTIambassador`. Fix was also ported across to the HLA v1.3
            interface. (`#39` - raymondfrancis)

 * `bugfix` Corrected indirection for processing VariableLengthData objects in 1516e
            C++ interface (`#39` - raymondfrancis)

 * `bugfix` Fixed `TimeFactory` compatibility problem in 1516e C++ with code generated from Pitch
            Developer Studio (`#39` - raymondfrancis)

 * `bugfix` Allow absolute file URLs in FOM module specification when creating a federation
            in the 1516e interface (`#39` - raymondfrancis)



v2.0.0 / 2013-04-01
--------------------

#### New Features

 * `feature` Added an IEEE-1516e interface for Java and C++. The interface is
             available across all supported Windows, Linux and Mac OS X versions.
             The initial implementation of the interface includes support for:

     * Modular FOM Support         (`PORT-106`)
     * Synchronization Points      (`PORT-70`, `PORT-71`)
     * Publish and Subscribe       (`PORT-70`, `PORT-71`)
     * Object Management           (`PORT-70`, `PORT-71`)
     * Time Management             (`PORT-70`, `PORT-71`)
     * Ownership Management        (`PORT-70`, `PORT-71`)
     * Various Support Services    (`PORT-70`, `PORT-71`)
     * Encoding Helpers            (`PORT-92`, `PORT-111`)

 * `feature` Added support for immediate callback delivery (`PORT-120`)

 * `feature` All distributions now pre-package their own JRE. The "no-jre"
             builds, also much smaller, were not used. (`PORT-100`)

 * `feature` JGroups communications library bumped to `v3.2.0`. (`PORT-91`)

 * `feature` Individual libraries now packaged for VC8, 9 and 10 on Windows,
             GCC 4.2 on Linux and Mac OS X. Full release and debug libraries
             included with each package. (`PORT-3`)

 * `feature` Each Windows, Linux and Mac OS X package now includes an embedded
             JRE for the platform. The `no-jre` versions, although much lighter,
             were not used and have been removed. (`PORT-34`)

 * `feature` When starting Java with the Portico jar file, it will now print out
             version and system information before exiting. For example, issue
             the following from `RTI_HOME`: `java -jar lib/portico.jar` to get
             output akin to:

  ```

#### Improvements

 * `improve` Added explicit calls to clean-up JNI resources at the completion of
             each `RTIambassador` call. Reduces memory footprint and potential
             memory corruption bugs. (`PORT-85`)

#### Bug Fixes

 * `bugfix` Fixed problem where sent ordering was always null for all object
            management callbacks in the 1516e interface. (`PORT-128`)

 * `bugfix` Fixed naming of 1516e 64-bit libraries. (`PORT-125`)

 * `bugfix` The `enableCallbacks()` and `disableCallbacks()` methods now
            work as expected. (`PORT-122`)

 * `bugfix` When calling an unsupported method, Portico will now log a warning but
            will not throw an exception. This mode can be changed via the RID file
            property: `portico.unsupportedExceptions = true` (`PORT-121`)

 * `bugfix` When running the C++ libraries in debug mode, the java side of the
            binding will now load back the debug library also. Previously it just
            always attempted to load-back the release version making viewing
            breakpoints in callbacks a bit tough! (`PORT-123`)

 * `bugfix` Portico now properly delivers success/failure notifications for
            object name reservations. (`PORT-127`)

 * `bugfix` The C++ 1516e interface now returns the correct Portico version when
            the `RTIambassador::rtiVersion()` method is called. (`PORT-83`)
